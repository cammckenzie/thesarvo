//var guide_xml='<guide guidestars="**" pagesize="1000" version="3">\n<header access="Turn left onto Safety Cove Road, just past the turn off to Port Arthur (about 200m past the petrol station / store).&#10; Drive to the very end of this road and park at the Remarkable Cave car park. A signpost marks the start of a formed track leading towards Mt Brown, and most cliffs in the area are accessed by leaving this track at the appropriate time. Access to Parrot Shelf: turn off to the right at a small sandy creek (after about 30 minutes). The top of the Parrot Shelf cliff is a short walk from here, and the base accessed at the southern end. Access to Paradiso: walk to the top of the Parrot Shelf, then continue south along the shore slabs for another 5 minutes. A short downclimb is required to reach the base of the cliffs, or otherwise abseil in Access to Dauntless Point: follow the track past the sandy creek until it starts to head left. Head a little to the right of the saddle between Mt. Brown and Dauntless Point toward a black dead patch (now regrown with plenty of thick scrub) near the base of the hill. From here, head up to the saddle where upon easy walking with an excellent outlook may be had up along the eastern edge of the cliffs to the highest point. The cliff edge may be followed the whole way to the end of the point, with a rough track providing access through scrubby sections (about 15 more minutes). It is also possible (and less scrubby) to branch off the main Mount Brown track when it starts to steepen (just after the triangular fork) and follow the contour around to the Dauntless/Brown col. Alternatively from the top of the Paradiso follow the occasional cairn up and right across the top of the Paradiso before ascending more directly to gain the top just north of the Dauntless abseil. Access to Mount Brown Main Face: follow the main walking track to a triangular fork below the slopes of Mount Brown and then take the summit track heading uphill. When about 50m from the trig station, turn west and head towards the highest point at the cliff edge (about 1 hour from the car to the rap station). The main walking track continues all the way to Crescent Bay, which is a worthwhile diversion (especially on a hot day), as well as having some additional climbing at each end." acknowledgement="by Marcel Jackson and Roger Parkyn, originally published in Craglets." history="" intro="The cliffs around Mt. Brown provide a substantial range of climbing in an exciting setting. Like half of Tassie\'s southern coastline, the rock is dolerite, but despite its location directly between Cape Raoul and Cape Pillar, there is not a column to be seen. Huge weathered sheets of featured rock form towering overhanging walls on the west side, while to the east the same formations make even larger slabs.  The steep walls have a heap of potential for some really fantastic cranking, and have already yielded a healthy harvest of classic sport climbs.  Climbs of most grades, styles and angles exist in relative abundance, but arguably the best aspect about this area is the atmosphere. There are few experiences as pleasant as sitting on the warm rocks at Land\'s End in the late afternoon sun watching the Gannets dive. Even the evil 170m cave cliff of Mt. Brown glows orange and succumbs to the magic. On the other hand, there are few experiences as dramatic and ferocious as the Paradiso when the sea gets up." name="Mount Brown" rock="Wave sculpted dolerite, 10-200m" sun="Afternoon sun" walk="20-60 minutes" id="1"/>\n\n\n<gps id="2"><point code="MBR010" description="DNA Land; Top of Stem Cell" easting="569331" height="32" northing="5216888" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR020" description="Parrot Shelf; Top of Geronimo" easting="569835" height="22" northing="5216469" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR030" description="40 Degrees South; Slab where you turn off to go to anchors" easting="569994" height="0" northing="5216028" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR040" description="40 Degrees South; Rap anchors" easting="569966" height="0" northing="5215989" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR050" description="Time Goes Bye; Rap anchors" easting="570343" height="168" northing="5215926" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR051" description="I\'ve Heard it all Before; Rap anchors" easting="570358" height="170" northing="5215911" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR301" description="No Contest (Hidden Face); Rap Anchors" easting="570826" northing="5215818" height="150"/></gps><image noPrint="false" src="mountBrownMap.png" width="800" id="3"/>\n\n<text class="heading3" id="4">DNA Land</text><text class="Discussion" id="5">This small area has some good climbs similar to the Cataract Gorge and is largely unaffected by swell.

Ascend 2m then traverse R on dodgy rock to the prominent crack line. Follow this, past the cave, to the 'step' of the Tier. &lt;br/&gt;1b. 30m. (17) Alternatively (better but a tad harder), climb directly up from the start for about 10m and then hand traverse R on the horizontal break to the cave, continuing up the original route. &lt;br/&gt;2a. 42m. Climb the crack line on the south side of the prow past the old dodgy peg (still there in 2007), continuing up the walls and chimney above to finish up the arête. &lt;br/&gt;2b. 25m.

Hard moves Lwards over this then up more slick rock to a DBB.</climb>   <climb extra=\"\" grade=\"20\" guide.action=\"submit\" guide.id=\"90\" guide.page=\"0\" guide.type=\"climb\" length=\"35m\" name=\"Tingles\" number=\"74.\" stars=\"\" id=\"95\" fa=\"H.Jackson, P.Jackson, Apr 1992.\">An excellent little route with a serious crux and a delightful finish. Start right of the previous two routes just right of the white streaks. Go up past two diagonal cracks. Go up the thin line on a steep slab and head for the obvious slot at the top where protection can be organised. Continue to the bulge on the left. An easy crack leads through this and continues up to the top.</climb>   <text class=\"heading3\" id=\"96\">Speaker Box</text>   <text class=\"Discussion\" id=\"97\">Very roughly, at the same level as the base of Sow Spur and about 200m left is a large rectangular boulder which is clearly visible from almost anywhere in Coles Bay. The easiest approach is via the foot of Sow Spur. When you get to the slab at the base of Sow Spur go left diagonally upwards (rather than following the track rightwards along the base of Sow Spur). After about 200 m of traverse across the hillside (slightly rising) you should be uphill of the boulder of \"Sophie\'s Evil Choice\". To continue on to Speaker Box descend from the east end of the Sophie boulder.</text>   <climb extra=\"5Þ\" grade=\"27\" guide.action=\"submit\" guide.id=\"93\" guide.page=\"0\" guide.type=\"climb\" length=\"25m\" name=\"The Crystal Maze\" number=\"75.\" stars=\"**\" id=\"98\" fa=\"Nick Hancock, Oct 2001.\">The blank looking face 10 metres left of Greenvine via 5 U-bolts (no lower-offs).</climb>   <climb extra=\"\" grade=\"20\" guide.action=\"submit\" guide.id=\"94\" guide.page=\"0\" guide.type=\"climb\" length=\"25m\" name=\"Greenvine\" number=\"76.\" stars=\"**\" id=\"99\" fa=\"Marcel Jackson, Peter Jackson, Dec 1989.\">A varied and characterful route up a great boulder. Start Below the one crack going up the middle and moving left at top. Boulder up to the glacis below the overhang, place a runner, and make a difficult mantel onto the hanging ledge on the right. Pull round the short impending wall and up to the big jug. Step left and follow the crack ot the top.</climb>   <climb extra=\"\" grade=\"25\" guide.action=\"submit\" guide.id=\"95\" guide.page=\"0\" guide.type=\"climb\" length=\"30m\" name=\"Speak Of The Devil\" number=\"77.\" stars=\"*\" id=\"100\" fa=\"Nick Hancock, Sophie LeRoux, Oct 2001.\">Start up Greenvine and then move right along the dyke to the arête, where a rockover leads to a U-bolt. Pass this with difficulty and finish up the arête.</climb>   <climb extra=\"2Þ\" grade=\"22\" guide.action=\"submit\" guide.id=\"96\" guide.page=\"0\" guide.type=\"climb\" length=\"10m\" name=\"Sophie's Evil Choice\" number=\"78.\" stars=\"*\" id=\"101\" fa=\"Sophie LeRoux, Nick Hancock, Oct 2001.\">Fifty metres above Speaker Box is a boulder with a sharp arête facing northwest. Climb this via 2 U-bolts to a lower off.</climb>   <text class=\"heading3\" id=\"102\">Mystic Cliff</text>   <text class=\"Discussion\" id=\"103\">This crag is located about 50 metres directly below Speaker Box. It can be identified by its very overhanging nature; being composed of big jutting roofs. The easiest approach is probably from above via Speaker Box, as the direct approach from just after the marshy gully on the Sow Spur track is through fairly dense bush.</text>   <climb extra=\"6Þ\" grade=\"26\" guide.action=\"submit\" guide.id=\"99\" guide.page=\"0\" guide.type=\"climb\" length=\"20m\" name=\"To Light A Candle Is To Cast A Shadow\" number=\"79.\" stars=\"**\" id=\"104\" fa=\"Nick Hancock Mar 2002.\">Just left of centre is a left facing corner guarded by a blank roof. Climb up slabby rock to a small bush and a 1 friend in an undercut. Move up right to a U-bolt then stretch across the roof to clip another. Gain the corner crack with difficulty and follow this to the capping roof. Move right to a rest on a spike, then traverse R along a rail to a hard finish straight up. 6 U-bolts in total. No lower offs.</climb>   <text class=\"heading2\" id=\"105\">Mt Mayson</text>   <text class=\"text\" id=\"106\">There are three crags on Mt Mayson with some OK routes and nice rock. To get there follow the walking track south towards Hazards Beach from the car park. After about 25 minutes the pyramid shaped upper crag is visible on the skyline. Walk another 5 minutes until the track starts going up hill over some slabs where you\'ll find a few painted yellow arrows marking the walking track. Leave the track here and head up towards a prominant boulder on the end of the ridge. Bash around the right hand side of this to gain the ridge, then follow the top of the ridge to the base of the less-than-vertical lower crag. In the middle of the crag is a prominent smooth white water streak.</text>   <image id=\"149\" src=\"mtmayson 1400.jpg\" height=\"438\" width=\"700\" legend=\"true\" legendTitle=\"Mt Mayson\" legendx=\"525\" legendy=\"14\">     <drawing>       <path id=\"60324\" points=\"127,185, 128,157, 130,118, 133,79, 145,77, 144,54, 143,18,\" d=\"M127,185C127.4,173.8 127.49869002195622,168.19592284297786 128,157C128.5013099780438,145.80407715702214 129.0007368896076,133.5885045221217 130,118C130.9992631103924,102.41149547787832 131.32806010842216,83.56996903697943 133,79C134.67193989157784,74.43003096302057 143.04018931811075,81.45411518611192 145,77C146.95981068188925,72.54588481388808 144.31197983969005,63.20340527085637 144,54C143.68802016030995,44.79659472914363 143.4,32.39999999999999 143,18\" linkedTo=\"115\"/>       <path id=\"5533\" points=\"258,421, 266,378, 275,328,\" d=\"M258,421C261.2,403.8 262.85409051692176,395.20997540742803 266,378C269.14590948307824,360.79002459257197 271.4,348 275,328\" linkedTo=\"109\"/>       <path id=\"18349\" points=\"300,421, 306,382, 312,324,\" d=\"M300,421C302.4,405.4 304.06217009035504,397.66412510296334 306,382C307.93782990964496,366.33587489703666 309.6,347.2 312,324\" linkedTo=\"110\"/>       <path id=\"87226\" points=\"466,425, 474,358, 476,253,\" d=\"M466,425C469.2,398.2 472.43343793743657,384.94486747609153 474,358C475.56656206256343,331.05513252390847 475.2,295 476,253\" linkedTo=\"111\"/>       <path id=\"73785\" points=\"503,427, 503,361, 517,347, 515,288, 517,242,\" d=\"M503,427C503,400.6 501.63481742291776,368.80104329761286 503,361C504.36518257708224,353.19895670238714 515.7153892653295,354.81471530257943 517,347C518.2846107346705,339.18528469742057 515,306.4173830931541 515,288C515,269.5826169068459 516.2,260.4 517,242\" linkedTo=\"112\"/>     </drawing>     <legend>       <climb>109</climb>       <climb>110</climb>       <climb>111</climb>       <climb>112</climb>       <climb>115</climb>     </legend>   </image>   <text class=\"heading3\" id=\"108\">Mt Mayson Lower Crag</text>   <climb extra=\"\" grade=\"14\" guide.action=\"submit\" guide.id=\"106\" guide.page=\"0\" guide.type=\"climb\" length=\"10m\" name=\"Antarctica\" number=\"80.\" stars=\"\" id=\"109\" fa=\"Sam Martin, John Anderson 10 Jun 2001.\">Start 5m to the left of Seams Ideal at the base of a buttress with a few semi-detached blocks.
