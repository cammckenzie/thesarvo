var guide_xml='<guide guidestars="**" pagesize="1000" version="3">\n<header access="Turn left onto Safety Cove Road, just past the turn off to Port Arthur (about 200m past the petrol station / store). Drive to the very end of this road and park at the Remarkable Cave car park. A signpost marks the start of a formed track leading towards Mt Brown, and most cliffs in the area are accessed by leaving this track at the appropriate time. Access to Parrot Shelf: turn off to the right at a small sandy creek (after about 30 minutes). The top of the Parrot Shelf cliff is a short walk from here, and the base accessed at the southern end. Access to Paradiso: walk to the top of the Parrot Shelf, then continue south along the shore slabs for another 5 minutes. A short downclimb is required to reach the base of the cliffs, or otherwise abseil in Access to Dauntless Point: follow the track past the sandy creek until it starts to head left. Head a little to the right of the saddle between Mt. Brown and Dauntless Point toward a black dead patch (now regrown with plenty of thick scrub) near the base of the hill. From here, head up to the saddle where upon easy walking with an excellent outlook may be had up along the eastern edge of the cliffs to the highest point. The cliff edge may be followed the whole way to the end of the point, with a rough track providing access through scrubby sections (about 15 more minutes). It is also possible (and less scrubby) to branch off the main Mount Brown track when it starts to steepen (just after the triangular fork) and follow the contour around to the Dauntless/Brown col. Alternatively from the top of the Paradiso follow the occasional cairn up and right across the top of the Paradiso before ascending more directly to gain the top just north of the Dauntless abseil. Access to Mount Brown Main Face: follow the main walking track to a triangular fork below the slopes of Mount Brown and then take the summit track heading uphill. When about 50m from the trig station, turn west and head towards the highest point at the cliff edge (about 1 hour from the car to the rap station). The main walking track continues all the way to Crescent Bay, which is a worthwhile diversion (especially on a hot day), as well as having some additional climbing at each end." acknowledgement="by Marcel Jackson and Roger Parkyn, originally published in Craglets." history="" intro="The cliffs around Mt. Brown provide a substantial range of climbing in an exciting setting. Like half of Tassie\'s southern coastline, the rock is dolerite, but despite its location directly between Cape Raoul and Cape Pillar, there is not a column to be seen. Huge weathered sheets of featured rock form towering overhanging walls on the west side, while to the east the same formations make even larger slabs.  The steep walls have a heap of potential for some really fantastic cranking, and have already yielded a healthy harvest of classic sport climbs.  Climbs of most grades, styles and angles exist in relative abundance, but arguably the best aspect about this area is the atmosphere. There are few experiences as pleasant as sitting on the warm rocks at Land\'s End in the late afternoon sun watching the Gannets dive. Even the evil 170m cave cliff of Mt. Brown glows orange and succumbs to the magic. On the other hand, there are few experiences as dramatic and ferocious as the Paradiso when the sea gets up." name="Mount Brown" rock="Wave sculpted dolerite, 10-200m" sun="Afternoon sun" walk="20-60 minutes" id="1"/>\n\n\n<gps id="2"><point code="MBR010" description="DNA Land; Top of Stem Cell" easting="569331" height="32" northing="5216888" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR020" description="Parrot Shelf; Top of Geronimo" easting="569835" height="22" northing="5216469" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR030" description="40 Degrees South; Slab where you turn off to go to anchors" easting="569994" height="0" northing="5216028" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR040" description="40 Degrees South; Rap anchors" easting="569966" height="0" northing="5215989" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR050" description="Time Goes Bye; Rap anchors" easting="570343" height="168" northing="5215926" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR051" description="I\'ve Heard it all Before; Rap anchors" easting="570358" height="170" northing="5215911" zone="55G"/><point code="MBR301" description="No Contest (Hidden Face); Rap Anchors" easting="570826" northing="5215818" height="150"/></gps><image noPrint="false" src="mountBrownMap.png" width="800" id="3"/>\n\n<text class="heading3" id="4">DNA Land</text><text class="Discussion" id="5">This small area has some good climbs similar to the Cataract Gorge and is largely unaffected by swell.

Climb up and L onto the overhanging face of the cave entrance and on up to the ledge (an awesome situation in rough seas ). Up the huge corner (initially a little loose) until an escape can be made R to the ledge just below the top.\n2. 5m. Escape to the loose cliff top.

Although the rock on the slabs to the north of this climb is extremely poor, the rock on Dauntless is at worst adequate and at best brilliant. A little south of the highest point of the Dauntless Point, the east facing slabby cliffs are capped by numerous big roofs. Abseil immediately before (i.e. to the north) the first of these down the edge of a very chossy slab for 55m (best to fix this rope - take extra 15m to anchor from bushes). From here a second 30m abseil from rap slings can be made off the L edge of the slab into the corner and down to a significant ledge about 15m above the water. The rock takes on a different character from here.\n1. 40m. Traverse L into the next mammoth corner then up the slab, tending L of the first roof to belay.\n2. 20m.
