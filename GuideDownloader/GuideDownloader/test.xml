	<header access="Ben Lomond is located about 50km south-east of Launceston. It shouldn't take much more than an hour to be at some of the closer crags, though with walks of up to two hours some are more suitable as weekend epics. Watch out for wildlife in the wee-hours, as the National Park is crawling with it. Anyone stupid enough to climb in the Carr Villa area during winter should note that they do not need to pay the entrance fee; this is for access via Jacobs Ladder to the ski resort. During summer there is no entrance station.&lt;br/&gt;To get there from Hobart, head north along the Midlands Highway, turning off R towards Evandale (just past Epping Forest, and 4km before Perth). In Evandale, turn L at the post office (Russell St) and stay on this road as it heads out of town and eventually turns to gravel (C413). Continue along the gravel road (take care - some corners are quite deceptive) until it joins another gravel road (Forest Rd) on a bend. Turn L sharply here and follow road to T intersection. Turn R onto the sealed Blessington Road (C401) and follow this until the Ben Lomond Rd turn off. Note: this is but one way of many, though it is perhaps the quickest.&lt;br/&gt;From Launceston, follow the road out of town to St Leonards then take Blessington Rd (C401) and continue to the Ben Lomond Rd turn off.&lt;br/&gt;Once on Ben Lomond Rd, head up the mountain (taking care for wildlife and the occasional fallen tree). To get to the Carr Villa scout hut carpark, take the turn off on the R just after the entrance station. For most crags park at Carr Villa.&lt;br/&gt;The crags are described left to right as you face them - eg East to West across the escarpment." acknowledgement="by Matt Perchard, Roger Parkyn &amp; Andrew Bissett (after previous work by Robert McMahon), originally published in Craglets. Other topos and route descriptions by Dean Rollins and Andrew Geeves." history="" intro="The cliffs of Ben Lomond provide arguably the best climbing in Tasmania. Anyone interested in the finer points of jamming can perfect their skills here, with soaring, unblemished cracks of various widths rising side-by-side. But beware, one of the problems of climbing here is gear related - it is not uncommon that you will require at least four pieces of identical protection, so perfect are the cracks - some are known to require a rack of at least fifteen friends! The other down-side is that some climbers also find some of the climbing a little boring, so unchanging is its nature. &lt;br/&gt;Being near one of Tasmania's premier skiing resorts (if there is such a thing), climbing is only possible during the summer months. For those inclined, winter climbing would certainly provide new problems - don't forget the ice screws! At an elevation of at least 1300m, the crags are very high (by Australian standards). Even in summer weather changes will occur very quickly, so don't forget your warm gear or be prepared to shiver. On warm summers afternoons though, this place is complete bliss. &lt;br/&gt;There are few facilities in the park, so bring everything - lunch, clothes and water (for some crags). Don't forget either some tape for your hands or bandages - the choice is yours! The best map of the area is probably the Ben Lomond National Park Map and Notes, available from most camping stores, though it's hardly necessary.This guide is far from comprehensive, but contains enough of the good routes to get you started. For a comprehensive guide see &quot;Memory of a Journey&quot; by McMahon &amp; Narkowicz.&lt;br/&gt;Note: The cliffs on Ben Lomond are widely considered to be in a no bolt zone. This is not the opinion of a mere individual, but the current consensus of the Tasmanian climbing community. In the future this situation may change so it should be considered an open topic for discussion (consensus climbing ethics aren't, after all, carved in stone). In the meantime please respect their current natural status; you are unlikely to run out of challenging climbs anyway." name="Ben Lomond - Northern Escarpment" rock="Alpine dolerite (varying from precise columns to blocky faces), from 50m to 200m" sun="Afternoon sun" walk="20-60 min" id="1"/>

	<text class="heading2" id="17">The Pavillion</text>
	<text class="text" id="18">The Pavillion can be seen from the Carr Villa scout hut. It is the large, foreboding looking buttress that sits on the lefthand side (as you look up from below) of the walking track from the summit The best way to get there is to follow this track until you are level with the base of The Pavillion. At this point you should see a faint track that veers off left across a scree slope towards the cliff. Keep skirting the bottom of the cliff until you can see a large ledge that runs along the base. This is best reached by bashing up the line of smashed scrub formed by some rockfall (you can't miss this, it looks like someone's been there with a brush cutter). Once on this terrace head to the left. The next climbs are found there.</text>

		At the lefthand end of this terrace (to keep going you have to start climbing, although after 5m or so you'd reach the top of a block). The line above you is the one you're after.
		1. Bridge up a little way, then follow the line up. Beware of the loose pillar. When the going looks like it is going to get really hard, go left (at the obvious horizontal) and then up to belay on a large ledge.
		2. You should start this pitch on the lefthand end of the belay ledge (10m or so left of the chimney the splits the buttress). Follow the cracks up to a rounded roof, pass this on the right, then trend right to a good belay slot.
		3. You can finish straight up, or better still is to head left under the roof, passing it on the left, then head back right and on to the top.
		Descent is usually made by walking down, via the summit/Carr Villa track.

	<text class="text" id="24">Directly above Carr Villa is a small but steep little cliff known as Local Loser. It is clearly visible above the Scout Hut, at the top of the scree slope, a short twenty-minutes walk away, and is well worth the effort. The cliff is also pleasantly sunny.</text>

	<text class="heading2" id="51">Frew's Flutes</text>
	<text class="text" id="52">The crag of Frew's Flutes, in particular Robin's Buttress, provides the most consistently hard cliff on the mountain and the most regular columnar cliff in the state, perhaps Australia. Varying in height from 30m to 180m, it is close to a 1km long. The distinct face on the L is named Robin's Buttress after English climber Robin Thomson, who, fresh from Yosemite, pioneered many of the exhausting jam cracks in 1978.</text>
	<text class="text" id="53">The rock is wholly sympathetic in frictional texture but unrelentingly steep.  Note that a high degree of fitness is required, even on the easiest routes.</text>
	<text class="text" id="54">See Robin's Buttress section for detailed access and descent info.</text>
	<text class="heading3" id="55">Descent Gully Area</text>
	<text class="text" id="56">The following route is along the track heading back to Robin's Buttress. It is a prominent dihedral about 50m along from where the track branches off the main scree gully.</text>

	<text class="text" id="60">Down the final gully to the base of Robin's Buttress, the descent passes a mossy black wall on the R with a few brushed lines. This is shady side of the Descent Gully Pinnacle. There are also some short routes on the Heathcliff facing (west) side of the pinnacle. They are on the L when looking up at Robin's Buttress from the scree, the first route being at the far L of the lower wall. Descend by tape abseil or by scrambling down the NW corner (coming out just along from SSHS). Routes described L to R (counter-clockwise).</text>

	<text class="heading3" id="66">Robin's Buttress</text>
	<text class="text" id="67">This buttress has the highest concentration of classics on the plateau; with a selection of long, sustained pitches of a variety of widths and styles.</text>
	<text class="text" id="68">
		Access:
		A cairned route heading west across the scree starts about 100m up the summit track, staying up high to avoid the bands of scrub. A quicker alternative is to head diagonally up through the scrubby scree to join up with the aforementioned cairned route. It is approximately 30 minutes of easy rock-hopping from Carr Villa to the buttress. When in the "scree saddle" under the big cliff, look up and you'll hopefully see the penis of rock (aka "the donga") at the base of the cliff proper. This is where Rajah and the like start.
	</text>
	<text class="text" id="69">Follow the cairns up towards Robin's Buttress to a well-worn approach scramble up the scrubby cliffs below the donga. After the section with the fixed rope the track forks; the L fork leads to the Rajah area (and routes further L), and the R fork leads to the Barbe di Vendetta area (and routes further R).</text>
	<text class="text" id="70">
		Descent:
		The routes on Robin's Buttress top out at a flat, rocky outcrop. At the carpark end a path is visible a few metres back from the cliff edge. Follow this and keep an eye out for more paths and cairns leading towards the head of the broad gully a few hundred metres away. Don't be tempted into straying L into the gully too early, or you may end up having to do some short (but easy) down climbing. The main descent track to the head of the gully is a very simple walk.
	</text>
	<text class="text" id="71">Once at the top of the gully, head down the scree following cairns. The main gully heads all the way down past Bullfighter Buttress, and meets up with the cairned route from the car to the Flutes. However, towards the top, another track branches off and heads L (as you walk down), up over the saddle, and down a rocky gully. The start of this track is cairned well, and it sticks quite close to the cliff line. If walking down, it is the quickest and easiest way back to the base of Robin's Buttress.</text>
	<text class="text" id="72">Alternatively, it is possible to rap off a number of the routes after the 'main' pitches by slinging chockstones and horns. This is a popular way to get off many route, as it avoid the lower quality rock towards to top of the cliff. However, despite the reputation of the top section of the cliff being a total pile of choss, a number of the more popular routes stay relatively solid to the end; for example, Rigaudon and Ramadan. If you do rap off, don't trust any existing tat blindly, and don't count on your old tat being there next time you do a certain route.</text>
	<text class="text" id="73">There used to be a bolted rap station just right of Rajah but this was removed in 2007, in the interests of keeping Ben Lomond bolt free.</text>

		"A line of ferocious purity that would have Comici speechless." Start 5m L of Rajah in a spacious alcove.
		1. 20m 18.  Climb the off-width until it becomes wide enough to get inside and chimney (crux pitch for most climbers; non-crux for connoisseurs of off-widths). Place gear high up in Ramadan before starting if you're not feeling brave (note: the official term for this is 'cheating', but it's better than smacking into the ground). There's gear higher up in the chimney, once you get inside the beast.
		2. 58m 20.  Jam, bridge and layback the dihedral above, then continue to a ledge just below the top. There are spots to rig a decent hanging belay from about the 45m mark onwards if your rope isn't long enough, but the full, rope-stretching pitch is recommended.

		A striking line, and again, a good beacon to get bearings off (when you find it). This is Rigaudon's neighbour, the recessed column with a flaring corner. Strenuous and sustained.
		1. 45m 19.  Start from the same alcove where Defender and Rigaudon start. Climb the finger crack to the R of Defender. The crack gradually widens to near off-width, before closing again into generously spaced finger/hand pods. Finish on top of pillar (as for Rajah). This is a long and strenuous pitch. Alternative finish: Exit out right via a flake/crack at about 35m, then continue up to same belay ledge.
		2. 35m 18.  Continue up the hand/fist crack on the R, through the (problematic) bulge, before easing as the rock becomes friable towards the top.

		1. 15m 19.  Steamy stemming up the dihedral. A finger crack provides some security. Belay at the ledge on the right wall (similar to the Barbe Di belay). Wires are useful as the column is offset, making placing cams a bit iffy.
		2. 30m 21.  Continue up the crack to belay behind the detached block.  Purists will prefer doing pitches one and two together, thus ensuring that characteristic Ben Lomond full-body-fuck.

		3. 22m 16.  Up the obvious gash above. Belay off to the L on bushy ledge below wide crack.
		4. 28m 19.  Up handcrack to bottomless offwidth. Hop into this then cruise on up to the same belay as Laendler/RADJ.
		5. 25m 18.  As for Laendler. Up recessed L-facing corner on R to niche, move L and up to ledge, then up short crack on L to block belay.
		6. 25m.  Scramble to the top.

		Blast up the middle of the Laendler Face. Sure to keep you smiling for a day or two. Take a biggish range of gear from tips to the #6 camolot. Doubles up to #4 camalot, maybe some triples of tips to #1 could also calm your nerves. Start 30m R of Laendler at a prominent NW-facing crack splitting the front of a column (as for Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door).
		1. 25m 17.  Up the crack (hands then offwidth then squeeze chimney) to ledge.
		2. 25m 24.  "The Fire Cracker" - On right side of ledge up past a flared hand jam start heading towards the roof, climbing on the right side of the fin. Traverse left under roof and finish on a ledge a few meters up and left.
		3. 20m 16.  Step back right and climb the line above, eventually break out left on face holds to access the ledge and the start of "the squeeze".
		4. 10m 17.  "The squeeze" - take some big gear!
		5. 25m 19.  Straight up twin cracks via some tricky layway moves. Belay on high ledge or take a few extra mid sized cams and link pitch 5 and 6.
		6. 12m 23.  More tricky moves eventually give way to hand jams. Provides an exciting end to this climb.
		7. 10m 10.  Head up the ridge until you can sneak around left to the start of pitch
		8. 25m 18.  As for Rock-A-Day Johnny. Up recessed L-facing corner on R to niche, move L and up to ledge, then up short crack on L to block belay.
		9. 25m.  Scramble to the top.
		Descent is best by walking down the first suitable gully in the Heathcliff direction (about 300m from the top of the route) - this is very easy and much quicker than the standard descent gully. You should come down directly in front of the main buttress of The Rocks.

	<climb extra="" grade="18" length="180m" name="Rock-A-Day Johnny" number="4." stars="" id="153" fa="R.McMahon, R.Frew, Jan 1974.">Ascends the ridge on the right of the cliff (ie. the skyline as seen from the car park); a great adventure and considered somewhat of a classic, though why is anyone's guess; huge and varied, with an atmospheric middle section and a fine crux last pitch bridging and jamming up twin cracks. Apart from the last pitch and a short grade 17 section on the second pitch, the climb is fairly 'cruisy'. The first route on the Flutes.</climb>

		A companion line to Haggis. Another proud line up this modest tower. Start in the cave chimney at the front of the tower.
		1. 30m 16.  Chimney up until possible to pull onto main wall. Move R past spike and up to belay below R of two cracks.
		2. 25m 18.  A tricky start guards the textbook hand crack.
		3. 20m 19.  As for Haggis. Good climbing up the deceptive R-leaning crack to the top.
		Descend off to the R: squeeze through gap to mossy ledge. Abseil from ledge to big spike slightly uphill (30m), then from spike to gully floor (25m).
