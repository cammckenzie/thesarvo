* Content update
* Improved guide table of contents: 
    - TOC stays open when you first open a guide - allowing you to quickly go to the section you want
    - allows climbs to be shown or hidden
    - shows sub pages as well as page content
    - search in page or all 
    - shows Map in TOC if there is one in the guide
* On a app restart the entire path to the last guide shown is shown
* Sync thesarvo index so that new and split guides automatically show up
* Improve weather links to use mobile BOM site
